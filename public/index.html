                <h2>Hi! I'm Jhon Brix!</h2>
                <p>
                    But you can call me <b>Brix</b>, 22 Year's old, living in the urban area of <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/V95BB9rWVUNVeLWd6" target="_blank"><b>Gerona, Tarlac</b></a> <br><br> 
                    A fresh new graduate of <b>Batchelor of Science in Computer Science</b> from

                    I have experience in building desktop software using the <b>Java Programming Language</b> during my years in College, then during our
                    Thesis, I started learning the <b>Python Programming Language</b> for Machine Learning and Object Detection Algorithms, didnt really learned Web Development, but hey I can learn it!

                <h2>So, What About Me?</h2>
                <p>
                    My passion and curiosity are the tools that I would use to push through beyond my comfort zone, even though I tend to overcomplicate things. <br><br>
                    I also possess the eagerness to learn new things, especially in the Tech Industry. Coding really helped me think of new things to do.

                <h2>Why ITBS?</h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that they offer good benefits for a fresh graduate like me. <br><br>
                    
                    But regardless of benefits, I applied for ITBS because of
                    a friend that told me to apply to ITBS in the TSU Campus and learning that some of my classmates were accepted and are already working
                    at ITBS made me try to apply. <br> <br>
                    
                    Well... thats the beginning!
