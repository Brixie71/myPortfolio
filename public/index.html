                <h2>Hi! I'm Jhon Brix!</h2>
                <p>
                    But you can call me Brix, I've been looking of a job that I would pursue for a few months after I graduated back in September 2024. 
                    I was looking for a job but couldn't really find one related to my field, so I thought to myself, <br><br> 
                    "Is there a chance that I could land in a big tech company?"
                    <br><br> Turns out I was lucky to get an opportunity
                    to apply at a Big Tech Company in Pampanga!

                <h2>So, What About Me?</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm 22 years old, old enough to know what matters more. I'm an only child, so I'm used to being alone at home, but not really far from home.<br><br>
                    Leaving home would take a lot of getting used to, especially when you've got to do things for your family, right? <br><br>
                    My passion and curiosity are the tools that I would use to push through beyond my comfort zone, even though I tend to overcomplicate things. LOL

                <p>
                    I'm still exploring opportunities, growing my skillset, and venturing into new challenges. Whether it's coding, designing, or solving real-world problems, 
                    Iâ€™m excited about what the future holds!
