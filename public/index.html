                    <p>But you can call me Brix, I've been dormant for a few months after I graduated. I was looking
                        a job but couldn't really find one related in my field so I thought to myself, "Is there a 
                        chance that I could land in a big tech company?" Turns out I was lucky to get an opportunity
                        to apply at a Big Tech Company in Pampanga!
